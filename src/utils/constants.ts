  about: `
Hello, World! I am Chánh Đại — a Design Engineer passionate about creating high-performance, user-centric software solutions with intuitive and engaging designs.

With 5+ years of experience, I specialize in building high-quality web and mobile applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and modern front-end technologies. Beyond work, I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into reality through personal projects.

One of my key projects, [ZaDark](https://zadark.com), enhances the Zalo experience on PC and Web, surpassing 80,000 downloads on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zadark) and 15,000 active users on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/llfhpkkeljlgnjgkholeppfnepmjppob) since 2022.

I'm also the creator of [React Wheel Picker](https://react-wheel-picker.chanhdai.com) — iOS-like wheel picker for React with smooth inertia scrolling and infinite loop support. It has earned 221 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/ncdai/react-wheel-picker) and was selected for **Vercel's Open Source Program** summer 2025 cohort, receiving $3,600 in Vercel platform credits, an OSS Starter Pack, and priority community support to fuel its ongoing development.

Let's connect and collaborate!
